| `m.youtube.com`   | `piped.video` |

## Bugs

Report any bugs you encounter on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/maxmilton/browser-redirect/issues).

### Known issues

We are aware of the following issues:

1. User's cannot add new rules. This is by design, as the extension uses a static rule set to simplify the implementation.
1. The extension is not installable via the Chrome Web Store. We recommend building the extension with your own custom rules using the steps outlined above.
